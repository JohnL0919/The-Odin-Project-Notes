  <h2>CSS Foundations Answers</h2>

<ol>
  <p>Q1. External CSS involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking
    it inside of an HTML's opening and closing tags. Internal CSS involves adding the CSS
  within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. Inline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements,
  though this is not recommended."</p>
    <p>
      Q2. Review answer  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations#class-selectors">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>Q3. To apply a single rule to two different selectors, we can use Grouping Selectors.
      This done by creating a separate section where two selectors are stacked on top of another. See below.
      <br>
      <img src="groupingselector1.JPG" alt="Grouping Selector">
      <img src="groupingselector2.JPG" alt="Grouping Selectors">
    </p>
    <p>
      Q4. To resolve this, we can use Chaining Selectors. Chaining selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation.
      <br>
      e.g.  We have two elements with the subsection class that has some sort of unique styles, but what if w eonly want to apply a separate rule to the element
      that also has header as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:
      <br>
      <img src="chainselector1.JPG" alt="Chaining Selectors">
      <br>
      What <strong>.subsection.header</strong> does is it selects any element that has both the <strong>subsection</strong>
      and <strong>header</strong>. Notice how there isn't any space between the <strong>.subsection</strong> and <strong>.header</strong> class selectors.
      This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one type selector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q5. Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors.
      There are four types of combinators in total.
      <strong>Descendant Combinator</strong> will only causeelements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent,etc)
      that matches the previous selector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q6. Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declariations tageting it, sort of like a tie-breaker.
      An ID selector will always beat any number of class selectors, a class selector will always beat any number of type selectors, and a type selector will always beat
      any number of anything less specific than it. When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of that same selector.
