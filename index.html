<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration.
The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML
it should use to render the document.-->

<html lang="en">
<!--After we declare the doctype, we need to provide an <html> element.
This is what’s known as the root element of the document,
meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it. -->

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <!--Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures
  that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from
  different languages correctly in the browser.-->


  <title>TheOdinProject Notes</title>
  <!--If we didn’t include a title element,
  the webpage’s title would default to its file name.
  In our case that would be index.html,
  which isn’t very meaningful for users;
  this would make it very difficult to find our webpage
  if the user has many browser tabs open.-->

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="Styles.css">

<!-- the <head> element is hwere we put important meta-information
about our webpages, and stuff required
for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.
